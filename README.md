# RFA-Segmentation
Python Notebook demonstrating RFM segmentation on an example dataset
- unfortunately, RFM has fallen into obsolescence due to various reasons:
1. not easily adaptable to change in customer base
2. built on historical data, don't factor in present-day data
3. require manual adjustment for shifts in market/customer behaviour
- However, RFM is still a prevalent method of customer segmentation and targeting relevant customers
